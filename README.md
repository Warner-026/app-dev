# **Fallout: My Favorite Series**
Throughout the years i've lived, i haven't been interested in watching any movies or series since i thought it was just a waste of time. But i became interested in a series made based on a game called "Fallout". I watched the season 1 episodes and i came to love the series for these reasons:

1. It showed the harsh reality in living in a post-apocalyptic world. every faction has their own set of rules and activities for their survival. Essentials in the wasteland are scarce and you need to always be prepared for what's about to come at you everywhere you go.
2. It was also showed there that not everyone can be trusted. Anybody will do what they and what they have to do in order to survive, whether it may be good or bad for you, the only thing that'll be stopping them to survive is death.
3. It shows that war and conflict, no matter the time, does not end. There would always be people with great ambitions and would stop at nothing in achieving their desires and goals.
4. It also shows that you must be careful with your every action as it has consequences you may or may not bear. Each step must be carefully planned out or else, prepare for the worst.
